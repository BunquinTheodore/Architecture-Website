    <h1>Techniques and Materials</h1>
    <p>The techniques of architecture in the sense that they will be considered here are simply the methods by which structures are formed from particular materials. </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="varsities-col">
            <img src="Images/stones.jpg">
            <h3>Stones</h3>
            <p>In most areas where stone is available, it has been favoured over other materials for the construction of monumental architecture. Its advantages are durability, adaptability to sculptural treatment, and the fact that it can be used in modest structures in its natural state.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="varsities-col">
            <img src="Images/bricks.jpg">
            <h3>Bricks</h3>
            <p>Brick compares favourably with stone as a structural material for its fire- and weather-resisting qualities and for the ease of production, transportation, and laying. The size of bricks is limited by the need for efficient drying, firing, and handling, but shapes, along with the techniques of bricklaying, have varied widely throughout history</p>
        </div>
        <div class="varsities-col">
            <img src="Images/wood.jpg">
            <h3>Wood</h3>
            <p>Wood is easier to acquire, transport, and work than other natural materials. All parts of a building can be efficiently constructed of wood except foundations; its disadvantage is susceptibility to fire, mold, and termites. The strength of wood in both tension and compression arises from its organic nature, which gives it an internal structure of longitudinal and radial fibres that is not impaired by cutting or long exposure. </p>
